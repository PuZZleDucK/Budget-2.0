### Project Description

1. An online education community - building better insights from citizens about what they needs and wants so the government can channel through the education budget for these real voices
2. A transparent, user friendly online community which helps the goverment glean specific insights of the wants and needs of the educators and tailor the education budget to suit (hopefully)
3. A transparent and democratic online community which helps the government glean specific insights of the wants and needs of the educators, and improve the education budget planning


### Goal

Public Input on Funding Allocation for a Budget 2.0

Vision: A transparent and democratic online community which helps the government glean specific insights of the wants and needs of the educators to improve the education budget planning

Mission: Provide online facility for citizens to have their freedom of speech in raising important concerns. Connecting one voice to the other to create a community through an online space, encouraging individuals to have their voice count


### Possibilities

Follow the vTaiwain model: 1. poll the population, 2. broadcast issue 3. public consultation, 4. binding decision making

Build a system where citizens can "share ideas", "make proposals", "summarize points of view", "put forward positions", "engage in conversations", "vote on outcomes" and refine other citizens ideas and so forth

Components completed:
- users [x]
- topics [x] education p.o.c.
- ideas [x]
- support [x]
- outcomes [x] - top ranking

Nice to do someday:
- replies [ ]
- edits [ ]
- moderation [ ]
