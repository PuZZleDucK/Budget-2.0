### Goal

Public Input on Funding Allocation for a Budget 2.0

### Possibilities

Follow the vTaiwain model: 1. poll the population, 2. broadcast issue 3. public consultation, 4. binding decision making

Build a system where citizens can "share ideas", "make proposals", "summarize points of view", "put forward positions", "engage in conversations", "vote on outcomes" and refine other citizens ideas and so forth

Components:
- users
- topics
- votes
- replies
- edits
- moderation
- outcomes

### Technology

- Rails 5
- Get the project ```git clone http://...```
- Install rails dependancies ```bundle install```
- Init DB with ```rails db:migrate```
- Test with ```rails test```
- Run development with ```rails server```
- Push to GitHub will result in deployment
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Push to repository with passing tests will result in [deployment](http://...)
